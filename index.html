<h1> Root Electronics </h1>
<b>What is this?</b>
<p>
So there don't seem to be many good resources on the internet to learn about electronics. 
If you want to learn electronics,
you will probably have to resort to buying books, and you have to
make sure you buy the right books. Despite this I still think electronics is a relatively approachable subject. 
This is my attempt to write a better guide on the core of electronics. No promises that it is good or even correct.

<b>What is electronics?</b> 
<p>
I like the definition given on the electronics wikipedia article. So you can go and read that.
But basically, electronics is any application of electricity that involves active devices.
That is, devices that use an electric signal to amplify or control another electric signal. 
It so happens that this manipulation of electricity is used in much of modern technology (It almost is modern technology).

<b>Necessary Background</b>
<p>
You should know basic high school algebra. Some ideas from calculus are also necessary. 
I started learning electronics before formally learning calculus. Given this, the necessary calculus material
is in the first section. If you already know calculus you can skip this.
