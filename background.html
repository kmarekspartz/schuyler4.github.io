<b>What is this?</b>
<p>
So there don't seem to be many good resources on the internet to learn basic circuit theory,
or honestly much on electronics at all. If you want to teach your self this stuff you currently
you will probably have to resort to buying books, and even with this approach you have to
make sure you buy the right books which can be a difficult task. In summary, there currently
just isn't much quality information to learn about electronics despite it being a relatively
approachable subject. This is my attempt to fix this issue.

<b>What is electronics</b> 
<p>
I like the definition given on the electronics wikipedia article, so you can go and read that.
But, basically, electronics is any application of electricity that involves active devices.
That is, devices that use an electric signal to amplify or control an another electric signal. It so happens that this manipulation of electricity is present in much of modern technology.

<b>Necessary Background</b>
<p>
You should know basic high school algebra. If you don't know basic high school algebra there
are many quality online resources to teach you. Some ideas from calculus are also necessary 
in electronics. I started learning electronics before formally learning calculus. This is 
written for my self when I first started learning electronics. The necessary calculus material
will be presented in the next section. If you already know calculus you can skip this.
