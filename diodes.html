<h2> Diodes </h2>
<b> Semiconductors </b>
<p>
So we have finally covered passive components. Now we can get into some real
electronics. For real electronics we need semiconductors. A semiconductor material
is basically a material that changes its conductivity (resistance) based on another
quantity: voltage, temperature, etc. A semiconductor component is an electrical component 
that exploits this behavior.

<b> IV Curve </b>
<p>
This is a useful tool for understanding semiconductor behavior. Basically we sweep
a voltage across a component while also measuring the current through it. Then the 
voltage is plotted on the X axis and the current is plotted on the Y axis. The IV
curve for a resistor is linear:

<b> Diode IV Curve </b>
<p>
Here is an IV curve for a 1N4148 diode that I took with my crappy homebrew curve
tracer:
</p>
<p>
As can be observed, the no current flows through diode until the voltage is ~0.7V in
the positive axis. A diode is in some sense a one way conductor. Current will only 
flow in one direction through it. Additionally, a diode also has a forward voltage;
if the voltage across the diode does not exceed the forward voltage then current will not 
flow even in the diodes forward direction. As can be obvserved from the curve trace, 
this forward voltage is only an approximation, and really the current through a diode is a 
steep exponential function of the voltage across it.
