<h2> Magnetics </h2> 
<p>
So we know that charge has a polarity, like charges repel and unlike charges attract. 
It has not been mentioned yet, but this idea can be abstracted slightly with the concept 
of an electric field. Basically, if we know some space is not electrically neutral, that is
there are some locked charges nearby. We can come up with an equation that takes in a point in 
space and a charge that may be placed at that point in space and outputs the magnitude and 
direction of the force that this charge would experience. This is basically what an electric field 
is, a way to quantify possible electric interactions in an area without actually knowing anything 
about actual charges. 
However, the electric force is not the only way that charges can interact with each other. Moving 
charges can also interact through the magnetic force. And, likewise with how there is an electric
field with an electric force, there is a magnetic field with a magnetic force. The only difference, 
is that for a magnetic field, the charges speed and direction of motion must also be taken into
account.
