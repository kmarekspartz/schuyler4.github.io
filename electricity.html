<h2> Electricity </h2>
<p>
Electricity is the movement and distribution of electric charge. 
</p>
<b>Charge</b>
<p>
Charge is a fundamental property of matter much like mass. Unlike mass, charge has a polarity
or sign. Fortunately for humans, charge can be moved around and manipulated much easier than mass can. 
</p>
<b>How Does Charge Move?</b>
<p>
Charge is carried by charge carriers. Often times these are electrons, but they don't have 
to be. Charge can only move well in conductive materials. 
It is important to know that charge propagates through a conductor via the charge 
carriers, but the flow of charge carrier is not equivalent to the flow of charge. When current
flows in a wire it moves very quickly, but the individual electrons do not. 
</p>
<b>Current</b>
<p>
Current is the amount of charge crossing a cross section per unit time. The more charge is flowing through a constant area, the more current there will be. 
Current is the rate of change of charge with respect to time (derivative) through a constant area. 
</p>
<b>Voltage</b>
<p>
Voltage is the pushing pressure that is applied to charge in a circuit. Voltage is always measured between two points.
</p>
<b>What is Resistance</b>
<p>
Resistance is a property of materials that determines how easy it is for charge to move through them. 
It takes work to move charge through a resistance, or to make current flow through a resistance (same thing). 
</p>
<b>Circuit Components (Lumped Element Model)</b>
<p>
When we design and build circuits it is helpful to represent them as components connected together. 
A lumped element model breaks circuits into components that have given electrial properties.
This idea is also key to how circuits are built and circuit components are sold. For example, say we
want to build a circuit with a certain resistance. We could buy a chunk of carbon, calculate the geometry necissary
for the resistance, and machine the carbon to built the resistance that we want. Alternativly, in the modern world, 
I can simply order a resistor from the internet that has the resistance I want. A resistor is a circuit component that
has a certain component. This approach has a number of advantages:
<ol>
<li>It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel (components) every time a new circuit is built. </li>
<li>There is an abstraction layer between the circuit design and the physical circuit that is built. I can add a resistor
to my circuit that has a certain resistance without having to know anything about the actual physical resistor that I
am going to use. Then later, when I move to the physical relization part of the design stage, I can select the actual 
resistor component.</li>
<li>The mathematics involved when solving for voltages and currents in a lumped element model is significantly easier. </li>
</ol>
Each component can be assigned to its ideal equivalent, and the ideal circuit can be solved without accounting for any
actual geometry. This trivializes the mathematics in many practical circuits.
