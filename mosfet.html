<h2> MOSFET </h2>
<p> 
Despite what some people think a mosfet is not its own class of device. It is a type of
transistor (These people also clearly don't know what MOSFET stands for). Remember how
a BJT is technically a voltage controlled device? While a mosfet is a "true" voltage 
controlled device. Like a BJT there are three terminals: gate, source, and drain. Also
like a bjt, there are two classes of devices: N-Channel and P-Channel (technially there
are also enhancement mode and depletion mode mosfets, however, no one uses depletion mode).
