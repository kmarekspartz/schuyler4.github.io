<b> What is Mathematics </b>
<p>
In this section only the useful stuff in mathematics is explained. How to solve calculus equations 
is not explained. Generally, 
</p>
<b> Calculus </b>
<p>
There are two useful ideas from calculus that are used in electronics, derivatives
and integrals. 
</p>
<b> Derivative </b>
<p>
A derivative is function that expresses the rate of change of another function. Putting an x
values into a functions derivative will return the rate of change of the function at that
x value. There are 3 derivatives that come up often in electronics. The first is the derivative
of a linear function. By definition, a linear function has a constant rate of change. So the 
derivative of a linear function is simply a constant.

 The second is exp(x) The derivative of
exp(x) is also exp(x). This apparently makes it magical.

 The third function is a sinusoid (sin(x) and cos(x)). The derivative of a sinusoid is also a sinusoid, but phase shifted
90 degrees. The maximum rate of change of a sinusoid occurs at the zero crossing so this 
is where the maximum of the derivative will be. The minimum rate of change occurs at the peak. 
Likewise this will be the minimum of the derivative. This will lead to a 90 degree phase 
shift between the sinusoid and its derivative.

<b> Integral </b>
<p>
An integral is the signed area under a function within some bounds (technically a definite integral). An integral of a constant is the area of a rectangle. Also for a constant function, If you take one of the bounds and
move it, then plot the integral at each x as a function you will get a linear function.
The integral of a sine wave with bounds that extend though many periods is zero. The negative
area is equal to the positive area.
