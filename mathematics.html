<b> What is Mathematics </b>
<p>
Before I go into the calculus stuff, here is a short my take on the philosophy and utility
of mathematics. Mathematics boils down into two things:
<ol>
<li><p>A maximally concise, universal, generalizable, and precise language with which to express ideas. </p></li> 
<li><p>A formal procedure that can make people behave like computers</p></li>
</ol>

I don't want to claim that #2 is not useful. However, these days 
it is only useful in semi trivial cases. If you find yourself doing a long computation to solve
a problem, you should probably ask if the long computation is actually necessary. Often times 
it can be simplified into a short trivial computation. If the long computation is 
necessary, then you are probably better off having a computer do it as this is what computers
are good for (You will have to know #1 to program the computer to do it). 

Now to #1. #1 is also extremely useful. Knowing the language of mathematics will enable 
you to understand ideas that you cannot understand without knowing the language of mathematics.
You cannot learn electronics without knowing some ideas from calculus and algebra. Unfortunately, #1 is often completely or mostly overlooked in most formal math classes.

<b> Calculus </b>
<p>
There are two useful ideas from calculus that are used in electronics, derivatives
and integrals. 
</p>
<b> Derivative </b>
<p>
A derivative is function that expresses the rate of change of another function. Putting an x
values into a functions derivative will return the rate of change of the function at that
x value. There are 3 derivatives that come up often in electronics. The first is the derivative
of a linear function. By definition, a linear function has a constant rate of change. So the 
derivative of a linear function is simply a constant.

 The second is exp(x) the derivative of
exp(x) is also exp(x). This is evident by looking at the graph.

<p>
 The third function is a sinusoid (sin(x) and cos(x). The derivative of a sinusoid is also a sinusoid, but it is phase shifted
by 90 degrees. The maximum rate of change of a sinusoid occurs at the zero crossing so this 
where the maximum of the derivative will be. The minimum rate of change occurs at the peak. 
Likewise this will be the minimum of the derivative. This will lead to a 90 degree phase 
shift between the sinusoid and its derivative.

<b> Integral </b>
<p>
An integral is the signed area under a function within some bounds (technically a definite integral). An integral of a constant is the area of a rectangle. Also for a constant function, If you take one of the bounds and
move it, then plot the integral at each x as a function you will get a linear function.
The integral of a sine wave with bounds that extend though many periods is zero. The negative
area is equal to the positive area.
