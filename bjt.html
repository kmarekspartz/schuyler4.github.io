<h2> Bipolar Junction Transistor </h2>
<p>
<b> Amplifiers </b>
<p>
Now we will move to active semiconductor components. Active semiconductor components 
are amplifiers. Fundementtaly, an amplifier is a component that we can feed a signal (in 
electronics a signal is a voltage our a current) 
into and get a bigger signal out of in some controllable way. That is, we should have
at least some idea how much bigger our output signal is.
</p>
<b> Turning an Amplifier Into a Switch </b>
<p>
Active components can also be used as switches. Much more than they are used as amplifier
in fact (What do you think the computer your reading this on is made from?). Switches are 
basically saturated amplifiers. That is, we amplify our input signal so much that our output
signal can't get any bigger. Then we basically have a switch. 
</p>
<b> BJT </b>
<p>
A bjt is a type of transistor. Unlike all the components we have looked at so far, transistors
have three terminals. In the case of an BJT there is a base, an emitter, and a collector. In 
an NPN BJT, our amplfied signal (current) flows from collector to emitter. 
</p>
<b> Current Amplifier BJT Model </b>
<p>
In one sense, we can think of a BJT as a current amplifier. There is a effectivly a diode
from base to emitter and another effectivly reverse biased diode from collector to base. Aka
current won't flow from the collector to the base. We can put a small current into the base
the same way we might put a current into a diode (series resistor) and we will get a larger
current from the collector to emitter. The amplification from the base current to the 
collector current is based on a property of the transistor called its beta. Note beta isen't
very constant and varies from transistor to transistor even within the same part. 
</p>
<b> Building a Switch with a BJT </b>
<p>
To make a switch with a BJT we simply have saturate our current amplifier. To do this 
we make sure that the component we are switching current through will only allow a certain 
amount of current, and we amplify to a greater amount of current. You should proably 
assume beta is much lower than it is specified when doing this (maybe 10). 
<b> Building an Amplifier with a BJT </b>
<p>
You should probably just use an op amp unless you are aiming for semi high power.
<p>
<b> BJT Transconductance Model </b>
<p>
It is worth noting that although the current amplifer model works for makeing switches it
is technically incorrect. Remember how the current through a diode is an exponential function
of its voltage. It turns out that the collector to emitter current is actualy set by this 
voltage. This voltage just changes very little with a large change in current, so we can 
approximatly think about it as set with the current.
