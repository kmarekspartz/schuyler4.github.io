<h2> Bipolar Junction Transistor </h2>
<p>
<b> Amplifiers </b>
<p>
Now we will move to active semiconductor components. Active semiconductor components 
are fundamentally amplifiers. An amplifier is a component that we can feed a signal 
into, and get a bigger signal out of in some controllable way  (in 
electronics a signal is a voltage or a current). 
</p>
<b> Turning an Amplifier Into a Switch </b>
<p>
Active components can also be used as switches. Much more than they are used as amplifier
in fact (What do you think the computer your reading this on is made from?). Switches are 
basically saturated amplifiers. That is, we amplify our input signal so much that our output
signal can't get any bigger. Then we basically have a switch. 
</p>
<b> BJT </b>
<p>
A BJT is a type of transistor. Unlike all the components we have looked at so far, transistors
have three terminals. In the case of a BJT there is a base, an emitter, and a collector. In 
an NPN BJT, our amplified signal (current) flows from collector to emitter. 
</p>
<b> Current Amplifier BJT Model </b>
<p>
In one sense, we can think of a BJT as a current amplifier. There is effectively a diode
from base to emitter and another effectively reverse biased diode from collector to base. Aka
current won't flow from the collector to the base. We can put a small current into the base
the same way we might put a current into a diode (series resistor) and we will get a larger
current from the collector to emitter. The amplification from the base current to the 
collector current is based on a property of the transistor called its beta. Beta isn't
very constant and varies from transistor to transistor even if they are the same part. 
</p>
<b> Building a Switch with a BJT </b>
<p>
To make a switch with a BJT we simply have to saturate our current amplifier. To do this 
we make sure that the component we are switching current through will only allow a certain 
amount of current, and we amplify to a greater current. You should probably 
assume beta is much lower than it is specified when doing this (maybe 10). 
</p>
<b> Building an Amplifier with a BJT </b>
<p>
You should probably just use an op amp unless you are aiming for semi high power.
<p>
<b> BJT Voltage Model </b>
<p>
It is worth noting that although the current amplifier model of a BJT works for making switches, it
is technically incorrect. Remember how the current through a diode is an exponential function
of the voltage across it? It turns out that the collector to emitter current is technically set by this 
voltage, not the base current.
