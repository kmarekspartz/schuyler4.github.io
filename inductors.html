<h2> Inductors </h2>
<p>
So there is one last passive non semiconductor component to go which is the inductor. The fundamental 
equation for inductance is as follows: <br>
L = φ/I<br>
Any time current flows through a wire there will be a magnetic field around it. This 
is a result of Ampere's Law. In this sense, any wire is an inductor, or at least has
some inductance. Okay, before we figure out how to build a better inductor and how 
it relates to magnetic flux linkage: let's look at the consequences of this. 
The other important law involved with inductors is Faradays law. Faradays law states a 
changing magnetic field induces a voltage. This is stated mathematically: <br>     
V = dφ/dt (As usual I have skipped a sign convention here. Additionally there is a
technical detail I skipped but it shouldn't matter for electronics) <br>
Quick derivation of equation that is useful in electronics: <br>
φ = LI <br>
V = d/dt(LI) <br>
V = L(dI/dt) <br>
As we can see, the voltage across an inductor is equal to its inductance times the
the change in current through it. This is because a changing current leads to a 
changing magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field induces a voltage.

<b> Inductors In Some Basic Circuits </b>
<p>
If you put an inductor in parallel with a voltage source it will lead to a linear current 
that increases to infinity (in reality the inductor will saturate). This is basically a short
circuit so it's recommended that you don't try this. 

Putting an inductor in parallel with a current source is equivalent with putting a wire
in parallel with a current source as long as the current source is constant. 

You can also build RL circuits like you can build RC circuits. However, these are not
often. You can look these up or figure them out if you are interested.

<b> Inductors in Parallel and Series </b>
<p>
Inductors in parallel and series follow the same rules as resistors in parallel in series, just inductors instead.
