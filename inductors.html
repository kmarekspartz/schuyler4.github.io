<h2> Inductors </h2>
<p>
So far we have not talked about how magnetic interaction in circuits at all despite there importance. Any
time we have a current flow in a wire we are going to get a magnetic field that wraps around it. This is a result 
of Ampere's law. A magnetic field can be visualized using field lines. Alternatively, there are more mathematical
ways to think about it using vector fields. If we have a changing magnetic field passing through a loop (changing magnetic flux), 
then we will induce a voltage across our loop. This is a result of Faradays law. Putting a changing current through a loop of wire will result in 
a changing magnetic field through the loop of wire, and this changing magnetic field will induce a voltage. If we want to amplify this effect, we can simply create more than
one loop. All this boils down to a voltage across our loop
that is proportional to the rate of change of current through it and the number of loops of wire. This idea is also stated in the inductor equation like so: <br>
V = L(dI/dt)<br>
L is the inductance which quantifies how much linked magnetic flux (magnetic field passing through multiple loops) is generated per amp of current.

<b> Inductors In Some Basic Circuits </b>
<p>
If you put an inductor in parallel with a voltage source it will lead to a linearly increasing current 
that continues indefinitely(in reality the inductor will saturate). This is basically a short
circuit, so it's recommended that you don't try this. 

Putting an inductor in parallel with a constant current source is equivalent with putting a wire
in parallel with a constant current source. 

You can also build RL circuits like you can build RC circuits. However, these are not used
often. You can look these up or figure them out if you are interested.

<b> Inductors in Parallel and Series </b>
<p>
Inductors in parallel and series follow the same rules as resistors in parallel and series, just inductors instead.
