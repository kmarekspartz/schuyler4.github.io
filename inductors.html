<h2> Inductors </h2>
<p>
So there is one last component to go before moving to semiconductors. The inductor. The fundamental 
equation for inductance is as follows: <br>
L = φ/I<br>
(in a sizable inductor φ is magnetic flux linkage not just magnetic flux) <br>
Any time current flows through a loop of wire there will be a magnetic field around it and a magnetic flux through the loop area. This 
is a result of Ampere's Law. In this sense, any wire is an inductor, or at least has
some inductance.  
The other important law involved with inductors is Faradays law. Faradays law says that a 
changing magnetic flux induces a voltage. This is stated mathematically: <br>     
V = dφ/dt (As usual I have skipped a sign convention here. Additionally there are some physics details I skipped, but they shouldn't matter for electronics) <br>
Quick derivation of the equation that is useful in electronics: <br>
φ = LI <br>
V = d/dt(LI) <br>
V = L(dI/dt) <br>
As we can see, the voltage across an inductor is equal to its inductance times the
the change in current through it. This is because a changing current leads to a 
changing magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field induces a voltage.

<b> Inductors In Some Basic Circuits </b>
<p>
If you put an inductor in parallel with a voltage source it will lead to a linearly increasing current 
that continues indefinitely(in reality the inductor will saturate). This is basically a short
circuit, so it's recommended that you don't try this. 

Putting an inductor in parallel with a constant current source is equivalent with putting a wire
in parallel with a constant current source. 

You can also build RL circuits like you can build RC circuits. However, these are not used
often. You can look these up or figure them out if you are interested.

<b> Inductors in Parallel and Series </b>
<p>
Inductors in parallel and series follow the same rules as resistors in parallel and series, just inductors instead.
